# üêæ Law of Large Numbers: Kangaroo Age Simulation

An interactive Streamlit application that demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers using a simulated population of Australian kangaroos. This educational tool visualizes how sample size affects the accuracy of estimating population parameters.

## üìã Overview

The Law of Large Numbers is a fundamental theorem in probability and statistics that describes how sample means converge to the population mean as sample size increases. This app uses kangaroo ages as an engaging example to illustrate this important statistical concept.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Adjust sample sizes and random seeds to explore different scenarios
- **Real-time Visualization**: Two-panel plot showing convergence behavior
- **Convergence Analysis**: Numerical table tracking how sample means approach the true population mean
- **Educational Interface**: Clear explanations and intuitive controls

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

### Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install streamlit numpy matplotlib
```

### Alternative Installation

You can also install from a requirements file:

```bash
# Create requirements.txt with:
streamlit>=1.28.0
numpy>=1.21.0
matplotlib>=3.5.0
```

Then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

1. Save the code to a file (e.g., `kangaroo_lln_app.py`)
2. Open your terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate to the directory containing the file
4. Run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run kangaroo_lln_app.py
```

The app will automatically open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## üéÆ How to Use

### Sidebar Controls

- **Maximum Sample Size**: Adjust the range of sample sizes (100-2000)
- **Random Seed**: Set a seed value for reproducible results
- **True Population Mean**: Displays the actual mean age of the kangaroo population

### Main Interface

1. **Convergence Plots**: 
   - Left panel shows the full convergence pattern
   - Right panel provides a zoomed view of later convergence behavior

2. **Convergence Analysis Table**: 
   - Shows sample means at key checkpoints (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000)
   - Displays the distance from the true population mean

### Interpretation

- Watch how the blue line (sample means) approaches the red dashed line (true population mean)
- Notice that larger sample sizes generally produce more accurate estimates
- Observe that the convergence may not be perfectly smooth due to random sampling

## üìä Understanding the Simulation

### Population Setup
- **Population Size**: 10,000 simulated kangaroos
- **Age Range**: 1-20 years (randomly distributed)
- **Population Type**: Discrete uniform distribution

### Sampling Process
- Samples are drawn with replacement from the population
- Sample sizes range from 10 to your specified maximum
- Each sample size is tested in increments of 10

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Law of Large Numbers**: Sample means converge to population mean
2. **Sampling Variability**: Smaller samples show more variation
3. **Convergence Rate**: How quickly estimates stabilize with larger samples

## üîß Customization Options

### Modifying the Population

To change the kangaroo age distribution, modify this line:
```python
population = np.random.randint(1, 20, size=10000)  # Current: uniform 1-20 years
```

Examples:
```python
# Normal distribution (mean=10, std=3)
population = np.random.normal(10, 3, size=10000).astype(int)
population = np.clip(population, 1, 20)  # Ensure reasonable ages

# Exponential distribution
population = np.random.exponential(5, size=10000).astype(int) + 1
population = np.clip(population, 1, 20)
```

### Adjusting Sample Size Range

Modify the `sample_sizes` array in the `demonstrate_lln` function:
```python
sample_sizes = np.arange(10, max_sample_size + 1, 10)  # Current: steps of 10
sample_sizes = np.arange(5, max_sample_size + 1, 5)   # Alternative: steps of 5
```

## üìö Educational Applications

### Classroom Use
- Statistics and probability courses
- Data science fundamentals
- Research methods classes

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the Law of Large Numbers
- Visualize sampling distribution concepts
- Explore the relationship between sample size and estimate accuracy

### Discussion Questions
1. Why doesn't the sample mean always decrease in distance from the population mean?
2. What would happen with different population distributions?
3. How does this apply to real-world polling and surveys?

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App won't start:**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check Python version (3.7+ required)
- Verify Streamlit installation: `streamlit --version`

**Plots not displaying:**
- Check matplotlib backend settings
- Try refreshing the browser page
- Ensure sufficient system memory

**Performance issues:**
- Reduce maximum sample size
- Consider smaller population size for testing
